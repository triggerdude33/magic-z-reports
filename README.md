# magic-z-reports
Tool for accounting of z-reports created by iZettle cashregister. The script works by automatically categorizing the products in a z-report by their label and summing each of the categories. These sums are then used to work out the accounting figures for each category.

The workflow is as follows:
1. Run the script on one ore more z-reports
2. Copy and paste the results into the accounting software
3. ???
4. PROFIT

### NOTE: As of somewhere in April 2020 the layout in the reports changed. Script has been updated to work with new reports, although the versions are not cross compatible. If dealing with reports from before April please use old_zreport.py as this is the version compatible with the old reports.

### Prerequisites
You have to have the command `pdftotext` from the package `poppler-utils` installed to be able to run the script.
The script is tested on version `0.62.0`.

### Product labels in iZettle
The script currently supports 6 product labels. The labels are: `Öl, Cider, Sprit, Vin, Alkfritt, Mat`. The labels have to follow the format `[label],[product-name]`. A valid product name would for example look like this:
`Cider, Somersby Pear`, `Sprit, 4 cl` or `Öl, Brooklyn, Brooklyn IPA`.  
The script relies on these labels to produce the correct accounting assistance output.

#### What to do if a product doesn't have a label?
Products without a valid label are going to appear like this:

```
If the product belongs to one of the labels it can be added manually to the corresponding list in the beginning of the script, in this case `list_Alkfritt`. Products added to these lists are treated as having the associated label.

**Make sure to use the correct category when adding products manually!**

These lists are only intended to work as a temporary fix, the labels should be updated in iZettle as soon as possible.

## Usage
The script is used with one command.
```
python3 zreport.py "file1.pdf" ["file2.pdf" ...]
```
Note that it has to be run using python3 command, python will not work.
You may specify more than one file if they are from the same date (event).
The file paths may be either the full or the relative filepath.

### Output
Here is some example output:
```

### Troubleshooting
The script will throw a date error if given z-reports with different dates. This is to prevent z-reports from different events accidentally being parsed together.

The script throws a parsing error if the sum of all the sales for all the parsed products does not match the sum provided by iZettle. The most likely cause of this error is a broken regex. This could be due to an invalid product name or iZettle making changes to the z-report format.

All the relevant debug-prints are left as comments in the script. When debugging a regex it helps to use an online regex tester like https://regexr.com/ or https://regex101.com/.
